    In robotics and computer vision, visual odometry is the process of determining the position and orientation of a robot by analyzing the associated camera images. It has been used in a wide variety of robotic applications, such as on the Mars Exploration Rovers. The classical approaches for solve the VO problems are usually based on the kinematics of the robot, so they can be easily induced to fail when either the motion of the robot or the environment are too challenging. In this way, novel VO methods use deep neural networks or attention models to improve or even replace the entire algorithm pipeline. In this project, we aim to brief introduce both algorithms and given sample results of the frameworks. Some obtained results are show in Figures \ref{fig:train150}, \ref{fig:seq2}, \ref{fig:seq4} and \ref{fig:seq5}. A video with the model results is available at \url{https://biteable.com/watch/deepvo-2406592}.
