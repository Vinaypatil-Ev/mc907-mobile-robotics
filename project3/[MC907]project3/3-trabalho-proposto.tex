\section{Proposed Work}\label{sec:trabalho-proposto}
    
    The proposed work, which can be seen in more detail in \citeonline{enun}, calls for the implementation of a project to solve a classical robotic problem. To explain the work in more detail, the next subsections will cover the problem and the tools used to solve it.
    
    \subsection{Problem}
        In robotics and computer vision, visual odometry is the process of determining the position and orientation of a robot by analyzing the associated camera images. This work aims to implement a end-to-end Deep Learning technique to preview the robot position at the enviroment.
        
    \subsection{Tools}\label{sec:org-proj}
        In order to carry out the proposed implementations it was used as programming language the $3.7$ version of Python. In conjunction with it, the Jupyter Notebook platform was used, since with it's easier to track the results of the applied algorithms and also because it allows the execution of specific pieces of code, which ensures greater flexibility in using the various algorithms used.
