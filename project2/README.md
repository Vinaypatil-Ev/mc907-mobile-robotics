# MC907 - Mobile Robotics - Project 2

## Subject of this Work:
The general objective of this work is to implement and evaluate at least 1 robot control behavior per group member.

### Goals:
1. Implement and evaluate at least 1 robot control behavior per group member (AvoidObstacle, WallFollow, Go- ToGoal) using models based on PID, Fuzzy, Neural Networks, etc;
2. Propose a behavior coordination strategy (state machine, planner, AR, subsumption, etc.)

### Prerequisites
