# MC907 - Mobile Robotics - Project 1

Repository to share projects and studies on mobile robotics. Course taught by the Institute of Computing of Unicamp.

## Subject of this Work:
The general objective of this work is to build, on the V-REP robotic simulator, an odometry and feature extraction system for the Pioneer P3-DX robot.

### Goals:
1. Implement the kinematic model of the differential robot P3DX and compute the robot odometry through its kinematic model.
2. Acquire sensor data as the robot moves around and display features (point cloud, objects, etc.) extracted from them in global coordinates.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Python3 or later
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
